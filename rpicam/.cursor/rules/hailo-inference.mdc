description: Correct usage pattern for HailoRT inference with stdc1.hef

- Always load the HailoRT **hef** once, cache context in a singleton.  
- Resize → normalize (mean 0.485/0.456/0.406, std 0.229/0.224/0.225) → NCHW tensor.  
- Model expects **224×224 RGB** – keep this centralized in `configs/model.yaml`.  
- Return `np.uint8` segmentation mask with class IDs (not probabilities).  
- Provide `warmup()` to run one dummy inference for timing stability.  
- Wrap all HailoRT calls in `try/except hailo_rt.HailoRtError as e:`; re-raise with helpful message.
